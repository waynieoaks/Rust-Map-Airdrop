# Map Airdrop
## An Oxide plugin for Rust

**Map Airdrop** automatically marks random airdrops on the in-game map.
Each drop is randomly within a blue circular radius marker - giving players a rough area to search, rather than an exact pin location.

This keeps the thrill of the hunt while improving visibility for casual or PvE servers.
